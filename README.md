# Week-1
This project aims to build a smart waste-sorting system that classifies garbage into categories such as organic, recyclable, hazardous, and other. Leveraging machine learning algorithms—particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—the system can automatically recognize and sort waste items based on images or sensor input.
